  abstract = {Networked Control Systems (NCS) are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in a growing number of applications, such as groups of unmanned aerial vehicles and industrial control systems. The evaluation of NCS properties such as stability and performance is very important given that these systems are typically deployed in critical settings. This paper presents the Networked Control Systems Wind Tunnel (NCSWT), an integrated modeling and simulation tool for the evaluation of Networked Control Systems (NCS). NCSWT integrates Matlab/Simulink and ns-2 for modeling and simulation of NCS using the High Level Architecture (HLA) standard. The tool is composed of two parts, the design-time models and the run-time components. The design-time models use Model Integrated Computing (MIC) to define HLA-based model constructs such as federates representing the simulators and interactions representing the communication between the simulators. MIC techniques facilitate the modeling and design of complex systems by using abstractions defined in domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) to describe the systems. The design-time models represent the control system dynamics and networking system behaviors in order to facilitate the run-time simulation of a NCS. The run-time components represent the main software components and interfaces for the actual realization of a NCS simulation using the HLA framework. Our implementation of the NCSWT based on HLA guarantees accurate time synchronization and data communication. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the tool as well as evaluate the impact of network effects on NCS.}

TrueTime makes it possible to simulate the temporal behavior of multi-tasking real-time kernels containing controller tasks and to study the effects of CPU and network scheduling on control performance. The simulated real-time kernel is event-driven and can handle external interrupts as well as fine-grained details such as context switches. Arbitrary scheduling policies may be defined, and the control tasks may be implemented using C functions, M functions, or Simulink block diagrams. A number of examples that illustrate the use of TrueTime are presented.}

  abstract  = {Wireless networked control system is gaining momentum in industrial cyber-physical systems, e.g., smart factory. Suffering from limited bandwidth and nondeterministic link quality, a critical challenge in its deployment is how to optimize the closed-loop control system performance as well as maintain stability. In order to bridge the gap between network design and control system performance, we propose an optimal dynamic scheduling strategy that optimizes performance of multi-loop control systems by allocating network resources based on predictions of both link quality and control performance at run-time. The optimal dynamic scheduling strategy boils down to solving a nonlinear integer programming problem, which is further relaxed to a linear programming problem. The proposed strategy provably renders the closed-loop system mean-square stable under mild assumptions. Its efficacy is demonstrated by simulating a four-loop control system over an IEEE 802.15.4 wireless network simulator - TOSSIM. Simulation results show that the optimal dynamic scheduling can enhance control system performance and adapt to both constant and variable network background noises as well as physical disturbance.},
